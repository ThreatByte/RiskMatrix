# RiskMatrix
 
## Introduction

- We were assigned to the HealthCare industry, and our group had to determine what risks were involved with the healthcare industry.
- Our group calculated risk by using the formula Likelihood x Impact.
- The Likelihood is the chance a threat could occur at any given time.
- The Impact is when the threat occured what would be the overall damage.
