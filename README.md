# RiskMatrix
 
## Introduction

- We were assigned to the HealthCare industry, and our group had to determine what risks were involved with the healthcare industry.
- Our group calculated risk by using the formula Likelihood x Impact.
- The Likelihood is the chance a threat could occur at any given time.
- The Impact is when the threat occured what would be the overall damage.

## Thought Process

- My section of the project was Software Threats, Human Threats, and Technology Threats.
- The risk was either High, Medium, Info, Low.
- Some examples were Known Exploit for Software Threats i graded this as a High Risk because a advisary when running a exploit can shutdown Hospital Equipment like Surgery Machines(Active or Non-Active), Workstations, etc.
- Malicious End User Human Threat i graded this as High Risk because in Hospital Enviorment if they were a technical person they could cause massive disruption to equipment or steal personal data.

## What I Learned

- There is Lots of risk and they can be graded in different categories.
- When looking at some of the Risks that i calculated i would change for example Lack of Qualified Staff at the time i based it on what job they are doing. Having Poor Qualified Staff can set back projects(Time, Schedule, etc) this should have been a Higher Risk.
